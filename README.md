# UNT Women in Computing PyGame Workshop
This is the code for our Python/PyGame workshop held on 4/14/2025! It's just a simple maze game; feel free to copy this code to your own machine and add/modify features. If you do, send a message with your updated game to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JamPFN54mu) so we can take a look!

Before running this code, ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the pygame library installed. To install pygame, type this in your terminal:
```
python -m pip install pygame --user
```
or simply
```
pip install pygame
```

Then, run the program using this command:
```
python wic.py
```
